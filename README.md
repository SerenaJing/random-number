# random-number
Given a function that randomly generates integers 1 to 5, write a function that randomly generates integers 1 to 7 .
If you make a array Old_Array[7] which has seven numbers, you can choose the repeat position in a new array.
And make sure the position P of max number of the new array.
Then you will get the random number from 1 to 7 which is the number Old_Array[P] in the old array.

P = n/7 * 1/n = 1/7  which is the random number from 1 to 7
